## Certificates
- A CSR (certificate signing request) is used when a new, or renewed, certificate is required for a web server. It is submitted to the company that sells the SSL certificates (such as VeriSign). 



## Virus , Work , Trojan 
- A virus is designed to spread from one file to another file on an individual computer. It is not designed to automatically spread from one system to another; that would be a worm.
- A Trojan is malicious code that appears to do something legitimate but does something illegitimate outside the view of the user.


## Protocol Analyzer 
A protocol analyzer will capture packets and timestamp each one. This tells you exactly what type of packets were captured and when. If the timestamps correspond to the network activity spikes, you know you have a match for the time. By digging into the packets with a protocol analyzer, you can find out exactly what type of traffic is causing the activity. 




## Encryption
- The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is an older type of block cipher selected by the U.S. federal government back in the 1970s as its encryption standard. 



- AES is the successor to DES/3DES and is another symmetric key encryption standard composed of three different versions of block ciphers: AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256. Actually, each of these has the same 128-bit cipher block size, but the key sizes for each are 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit, respectively.

- The RSA encryption protocol is an asymmetric algorithm used for the key exchange during secure web sessions. Other options for key exchange include Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve, with or without ephemeral properties.
